MeowSynth recreated in ComputerCraft!

This was my first time creating a software synthesizer from scratch, and I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to recreate [MeowSynth](https://lostsoftwarearchives.neocities.org/Meow/) in ComputerCraft!

The sound of the low pass filter does not yet exactly sound like the original MeowSynth's filter. The original MeowSynth sounds like the "12db fast LP filter" in FL Studio, which is different from the standard "12db LP filter" in FL.

### How to install
Download MeowSynthCC from the [PineStore](https://pinestore.cc/projects/audio/7/meowsynthcc)!

Or alternatively install it using the following command:
```
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichielP1807/MeowSynthCC/main/installer.lua
```
And then run `meow` to start MeowSynthCC!
